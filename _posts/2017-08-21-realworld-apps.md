Useful repo to see what JS (and to a lesser degree backend) frameworks look like in real world use cases.

It collects implementation in various framework of a medium.com clone, and tries to show good practice for projects organization using the said framework. This is not intended to be used to learn a framework, but to improve your knowledge of it by showing examples of real world use that go beyond the simple todo app that most tutorials present.
